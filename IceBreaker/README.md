# Get to Know You Icebreaker :busts_in_silhouette::thought_balloon:
This python script will randomly generate an icebreaker question that is read-in from the csv file. 

- Eliminates questions that have been answered already
- Takes into account number of students to available Icebreaker questions. So, if there are more students than there are q's, then repetition will be necessary and list of recorded q's will be adjusted accordingly.

## Instructions 
1. Press 'enter' to generate a question
2. Press 'q' to quit the program

Note: Other key inputs will be ignored. 

###### Need to finish: :bangbang: 
- [x] If there are more students than there are q's, need to notify user and reset list that records q's that have been answered

Created with the intention to get to know more about individual students in the classroom :purple_heart:
